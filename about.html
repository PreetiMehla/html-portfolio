<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I, Preeti Mehla who lived with my in-laws in India had a big dream to earn respect in the society. For that, my husband,
Harshit Mehla always encourages me and help me in every way possible.</p>

<p>Finally, one day when I went to my college, our teacher Mr. Bharat advised me to join a course and said that this
  course will definitely help me to sharpen my skills.</p>

<p>After taking guidance from him, I joined that course. Till now, I am learning from that couse and build my own 
  website using html and I hope that it will help me in achieving my goals.</p>
